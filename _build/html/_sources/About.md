# Overview of project
I am Upasana, a 4th year student affiliated to the School of Physical Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar India. This computational project is as part of coursework for Plasma Physics and Magnetohydrodynamics taken by Dr Luke Chamandy at the same institute. 

We are expected to solve numerically the mean-field galactic dynamo equations derived using the first order smoothing approximation, $$E = \alpha B − \eta_T \nabla \times B$$, in the kinematic regime. The project has been divided into three tasks:

## Task 1:

Solving the diffusion equation. That is, the equations omitting the ∇ × (V × B) and α terms, so that the only terms remaining on the RHS are those involving ηt (or ηT = ηt + η, to be precise).

- This task is common to all students, but half of the class is solving the diffusion equation in z and the other half in r (under the no-z approximation). I have been assigned the latter.
- To explore the evolution of the magnetic field magnitude and of the exponential decay rate.
- Explore the evolution of the spatial solution for Br and Bφ, and of the pitch angle of the mean
magnetic field p.
- Explore how different boundary conditions affect the results.
- Explore how different seed fields affect the results.

Right now, this website pertains to only Task 1.

## Task 2:
Will be updated.

## Task 3:
Will be updated
